            <h1> Case Study: - Library Management System  </h1>
            <p>
                The SE VLabs Institute has been recently setup to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the field of Software Engineering. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing the time, The HOD has proposed to develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of teachers and students of the institute. The head of the department (HOD) wants to automate the manual work. He envisions that LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting at his desk/chamber. For the library staff, this system aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian will have administrative privileges and complete control of the system. Considering the low budget that he has at his disposal, he entrusts the work to a team of student volunteers.

            <p>
                The HOD introduced the volunteers to the librarian to brief the team about the aspects of the Library management system. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The librarian tells the team that since many students take admission every year in the Insititute, she wants the facility for new students to register themselves with the Library information system to avail its facilities. On successful registration, a user ID and password would be provided to the member. He has to use these credentials for any future transaction in LIS. New teachers can register themselves too.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The librarian wants the ability to deregister any user if she deems fit. Since many new books get published every year and many books get outdated, the librarian also wants the facility to add new books or remove books from the database of LIS. The librarian wants to limit the number of books that students and teachers can borrow at once to 2 and 5 respectively, also the students and teachers can borrow a book for a maximum of 20 and 30 days respectively. The user can borrow a new book only when he returns the borrowed books depending upon the maximum number he can borrow. A user cannot borrow a book only if it has not been booked in advance or borrowed by some other user. Since some users don’t return the books in time, the librarian wants the system to have the ability to send notification to users to remind them of the due date. In case a user damages or loses a book, then the librarian can ask for reimbursement accordingly, or deregister the repeat offenders.

                The team then went to meet some students to find out their expectations. Many Students want to be able to search for a book to see if it is present in the institute’s library. A book can be searched by its title or author’s name or Publisher’s name. Since many times, a book which a student wants has already been borrowed, then students want the facility to borrow a book in advance from the date whenever it gets returned to the library. Any Student who has issued a book might find that his requirement is not fulfilled by 20 days. In that case, he might choose to reissue the book, and get permission to keep it for more days, or the Student can return the book in advanced before the due date if he has finished the book. The students want to be able to see the current status of their profiles, I.e. what is the number of books they have borrowed? what is the due date to return these books, Which book is available to be borrowed, if it's not then from which date can it be booked in advance? Students should also be able to see any due amount or reimbursements to be made to the Institute library.
